## ✨ Features

This portfolio is packed with modern features to create a memorable "wow" effect.

## 🎨 Visuals & Animations

Interactive 3D Background: A dynamic, mouse-responsive "NET" animation powered by Vanta.js.

Cursor Spotlight Effect: A subtle, radial gradient spotlight follows the user's mouse, illuminating the content.

Preloading Animation: A clean loading screen with a pulsing logo fades out once the site is ready.

Fade-in on Scroll: Sections gracefully fade in and slide up as the user scrolls, powered by the Intersection Observer API.

Gradient Typing Effect: A "typing" animation in the hero section with a custom gradient text.

## 📱 UI/UX

Fully Responsive: A clean, mobile-first design with a full-screen hamburger menu for small devices.

Auto-hiding Navbar: The sticky navigation bar disappears on scroll-down and reappears on scroll-up for an unobstructed view.

Smooth Scrolling: All anchor links (#about, #contact) scroll smoothly to their sections.

"Let's Connect" CTA: The main button in the hero section directs users straight to the contact form.

## 🛠️ Functionality

Functional Contact Form: A live contact form that sends messages directly to my email using FormSubmit.

Dynamic Skills Section: A grid of my technical skills complete with logos from Devicon.

## ♿ Accessibility

Reduced Motion Support: All major animations (Vanta.js, typing, fade-in) are automatically disabled if a user's system prefers-reduced-motion.

Semantic HTML & ARIA: aria-label attributes are used for all icon-only buttons for screen reader accessibility.
